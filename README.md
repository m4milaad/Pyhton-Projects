## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy of these projects up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. It is also highly recommended to use a **virtual environment** for each project to manage dependencies.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/m4milaad/Pyhton-Projects.git](https://github.com/m4milaad/Pyhton-Projects.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Pyhton-Projects
    ```

3.  **Set up a specific project:**
    Navigate into the folder of the project you want to run. For example:
    ```sh
    cd "Snake Game"/
    ```

4.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    * **Create:**
        ```sh
        python -m venv venv
        ```
    * **Activate on Windows:**
        ```sh
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **Activate on macOS/Linux:**
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5.  **Install the required packages:**
    Some projects may have a `requirements.txt` file listing their dependencies. Install them using pip:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If a project doesn't have a `requirements.txt` file, you may need to install libraries like `pandas` or `colorgram` manually.)*

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies for a specific project, you can run it from the command line.

For example, to run the main script of a project:
```sh
python main.py
```
Please refer to the comments within each project's source code for more specific instructions.
